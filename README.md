# ðŸš¨ Drowsiness Detection System

A real-time driver drowsiness detection system using OpenCV, Dlib, and TensorFlow/Keras.  
The system monitors **eye closure** and **yawning** using a webcam and raises an alert if drowsiness is detected.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Detects **closed eyes** using a trained CNN model
- Detects **yawning** using **Dlib 68 facial landmarks**
- Calculates how long the eyes have been closed
- Combines both indicators to trigger a drowsiness alert
- Plays an alarm sound when the user is drowsy
- Real-time processing via webcam
